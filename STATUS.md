# GOBS Status

*Auto-maintained by Claude Code at end of each session. For session handoff. Single source of truth for "what's the state right now."*

**Last updated:** 2026-05-26 (evening, blind-draw Stableford fix)
**Session purpose:** Fix scoring bug in `stableford_standard` / `gobs_stableford` team totals on rounds that had `blind_draws` fills. Round 155 (2026-05-25) displayed Team 1 = 105 (should be 139) — the drawn player's 34 Stableford points were never added to the short team. Root cause: the per-team `computeRoundResult` call in [src/lib/round/results.ts](src/lib/round/results.ts) only knew about that team's own `round_players`; `blind_draws` rows were threaded to the display caption but not into the engine. Fix landed at the engine layer: `RoundInput` now accepts an optional `blindDraws[]`, `RoundResult` gains a separate `blindDrawTotal` + `blindDrawPerHole` accumulator (the per-hole invariant "teamScore = sum of perPlayer.points" stays intact for the team's own players). `results.ts` builds the input from existing `blindDrawRows` + lookups and adds the accumulator into the headline total + F9/B9 leg totals. Best-N formats deliberately out of scope this session — engine silently ignores `blindDraws` for them (TODO in code). Three new Stableford engine tests pass; full suite **374/374** (was 371). `tsc --noEmit` clean.

## 2026-05-26 (evening)

### Where we left off

**Fix shipped.** Engine API change is additive (new optional input field; two new always-present output fields with `0` / `{}` defaults). Stableford team totals on `/round/[id]/summary` and the live leaderboard now include drawn-player points. Round 155 expected display after reload: Team 1 = 139, Team 2 = 129 (was 105 vs 129). No DB backfill needed — team totals are computed at read time.

**Files touched:**
- `src/lib/scoring/types.ts` — new `BlindDrawInput` type, optional `RoundInput.blindDraws`, new `RoundResult.blindDrawTotal` + `RoundResult.blindDrawPerHole`.
- `src/lib/scoring/engine.ts` — `computeRoundResult` aggregates drawn-player Stableford points (resolves the format-correct point table once at the round level; `mergePointTable(GOBS_STABLEFORD_POINTS, formatConfig.point_values)` for GOBS).
- `src/lib/round/results.ts` — builds per-team `BlindDrawInput[]` from the existing `blindDrawRows` + `playerLookup` + `scoresByRpId` + `holesByTee`. `total = rawTeamScore + blindDrawTotal − teamPar`. `legTotal()` adds `blindDrawPerHole[h]` for each hole in F9 / B9.
- `tests/lib/scoring/engine-stableford.test.ts` — three new tests + tightened existing baseline (now asserts `blindDrawTotal` defaults to 0 / `{}`).

**Audit-pass (CLAUDE.md principle #1, "writes must audit all reads"):**
- `result.teamScore` readers: `engine.ts` internal; `scorecard/page.tsx` (in-round, no blind draws yet — unchanged); `results.ts:247` (rawTeamScore). All correct under the new semantic ("team's own players only").
- `result.perHole[h].teamScore` readers: `results.ts` `legTotal()` (updated to also add `blindDrawPerHole[h]`); `scorecard/page.tsx:750,810` (in-round, unchanged). Per-hole invariant preserved.
- `team.total` readers: `rank.ts` (sort), `RoundResultsView` (display). Both pick up the fix through the new headline formula.
- `team.f9Total` / `team.b9Total` readers: `RoundResultsView`. Picks up fix via `legTotal()` change.
- `BlindDrawFill.drawnPlayerNetValue` readers: `RoundResultsView` caption. Unchanged (per-fill aggregate computed independently from per-team accumulator; both paths produce consistent numbers because both use the drawn player's own CH + tee SI).

### Today's commits

- (this session) — fix(scoring): include blind-draw points in Stableford team totals

### Tomorrow's priority

1. **Manual verification of round 155** — reload `/round/155/summary`; confirm Team 1 = 139, Team 2 = 129.
2. **Resume previous H3.x track** — `seasons` table + migration is still the top remaining feature priority per 2026-05-24's plan.
3. **Best-N blind-draw scoring** — same engine path likely has the same gap for 2-Ball / 3-Ball / Best Ball formats; engine currently silently ignores `blindDraws` for them with a `// TODO` marker. Worth scoping next time best-N rounds need to include drawn players.

### Considered but not changed (confession)

- **`results.ts:359-382` `drawnPlayerNetValue` block** — duplicates the engine's drawn-player aggregation for the per-fill caption. The new `blindDrawPerHole` lets us derive per-fill totals too, so this could be folded into the engine output. Left as-is to keep this commit narrow.
- **Best-N blind-draw scoring** — same bug shape almost certainly affects 2-Ball / 3-Ball / Best Ball; spec explicitly deferred.
- **`tee_id` mixed-tee handling** in `results.ts`'s `firstTeeId` lookup — pre-existing; not touching.

## 2026-05-24 (evening)

### Where we left off

**Part 1 — Admin PIN gate (D1) shipped.** `/admin` and `/admin/*` now gated behind a 4-digit PIN. Middleware on the Edge runtime (`src/middleware.ts`) checks an HMAC-SHA256-signed `admin_session` cookie (90-day expiry). Login page at `/admin/login` uses a server action (`src/app/admin/login/actions.ts`) that timing-safely compares the submitted PIN against `process.env.ADMIN_PIN`. No rate limiting per spec. Homepage Admin button unchanged. 7/7 unit tests passing on the sign/verify helpers (round-trip, tampered, expired, malformed). `tsc --noEmit` clean.

**Crucial pre-deploy step still on Jonathan:** Add `ADMIN_PIN` and `ADMIN_COOKIE_SECRET` to Vercel Production + Preview + Development environments. Without them, the deployed gate will reject every PIN with "Incorrect PIN" and the Edge runtime will log `ADMIN_PIN is not set` / `ADMIN_COOKIE_SECRET is not set` per request. Local `.env.local` is already set.

**Part 2 — Jeff Irvin White tees (DB-only, no commit).** Mental model in the spec was imprecise: there is no Wayne hardcode in code. Tee preference is stored as a per-row column `players.preferred_tee_id`. Discovered TWO Waynes — only Wayne Vincent (id=55) had `preferred_tee_id = 2` set; Wayne Hashimoto (id=45) is NULL (uses league default). Updated Jeff Irvin (id=22) `preferred_tee_id` from NULL → 2 (White) via Supabase MCP. Verified with RETURNING in same round-trip.

### Today's commits

- `8234b9e` — docs: 2026-05-24 evening doc reconciliation — D1 closed, H1 withdrawn, Phase E v2 + H3.x precursor (Part 3)
- `828bbf1` — Add admin PIN gate (D1) (Part 1)
- `d506460` — feat(player-profile): Phase E1 v1 — Played With section with four buckets (morning)
- `f04d79a` — chore: update STATUS.md for 2026-05-24 Phase E1 v1 session (morning)

### DB changes (today, not in git history)

- `UPDATE players SET preferred_tee_id = 2 WHERE id = 22` — Jeff Irvin → White tees, matches Wayne Vincent's pattern. No migration file; per-row data update, not a schema change.

### Tomorrow's priority

Per the new active-priority order locked in ROADMAP.md today (TD22 → H3.x → Phase E v2 → E2/E3/E4 → H.2 → F.1 → G):

1. **Manually add Vercel env vars** before any deploy: `ADMIN_PIN`, `ADMIN_COOKIE_SECRET` to Production + Preview (Development blocked for sensitive vars — expected; local `.env.local` covers dev). Without these the deployed /admin path is broken (rejects every PIN).
2. **Manual smoke test of the PIN gate** on `npm run dev` per the spec's 7-step checklist (clear cookies → /admin redirects → wrong PIN → see error → correct PIN → lands on /admin → refresh stays in → /admin/players direct hit redirects correctly).
3. ~~**TD22**~~ — **closed late evening 2026-05-24.** Polyfill in `tests/setup-dom.ts` rebinds `globalThis.localStorage`/`sessionStorage` from the JSDOM instance vitest exposes at `globalThis.jsdom`. Suite is **368/368** green again. Root cause was deeper than the original guess: Node 26 ships an experimental built-in `localStorage` global that returns undefined without `--localstorage-file`, and its descriptor wins against vitest's `populateGlobal` step. The `--localstorage-file` warning is gone from test output, confirming jsdom storage is now active.
4. **H3.1 — `seasons` table + migration** is the gating dep for everything in H3.x. **This is now the top remaining priority.**
5. **Small follow-up with Dad next time it comes up naturally:** Wayne Hashimoto (id=45) `preferred_tee_id` is NULL — does he actually play a specific tee, or is the league default (White/Yellow Combo) correct?
6. **Carry-over beta feedback from 2026-05-22:** confirm_join modal switch from one-button to two-button. Still outstanding.

### Doc-fix log (resolved this session, no longer carry-over)

- ✅ CLAUDE.md `played_with_matrix` schema corrected (was integer FK → now text full_name string). Caption added.
- ✅ New Engineering principle #4 added to CLAUDE.md.
- ✅ H1 withdrawn / D1 closed in ROADMAP.md.
- ✅ Phase E expanded with v2 items (E5 reframed, E6 added).
- ✅ H3.x sub-items added as season management precursor.
- ✅ Played With v2 Decisions Locked subsection added.
- ✅ **TD22 closed** — test env polyfill in `tests/setup-dom.ts` for Node 26 localStorage shadowing. Suite 368/368.

### Independent issues surfaced during TD22, not fixed

- **`tests/app/player-profile-ordering.test.tsx`** logs to stderr `supabase.from(...).select(...).eq(...).gt is not a function` — the test's supabase mock doesn't chain `.gt()` after `.eq()` for the `src/app/player/[id]/page.tsx:120` played-with query. Test passes only because the failed load is swallowed and the assertion doesn't depend on played-with data. Real coverage of that code path is missing. Worth a separate small task.
- **`DEP0205` Node deprecation** — `module.register() is deprecated. Use module.registerHooks() instead.` From vitest/vite internals on Node 26. Cosmetic; will resolve when vitest upgrades. Ignore.

## Previous session — 2026-05-22 (morning)

### Where we left off

Bug surfaced live this morning: Dad and Jonathan setting up teams on two phones at the same time merged into one team of 6 instead of two separate teams. Diagnosed as both concurrent race AND sequential stale-data collision on client-side team_number computation. Shipped ea04dd0: atomic team creation via Postgres RPC + picker refetch on open. Migration 011 applied to prod. Live-verified both scenarios with two devices — concurrent and sequential stale-data both produce correct sequential team numbers now. Additional manual verification: picker shows "Team N" captions for already-assigned players (refetch working), confirm_join modal fires correctly for mixed selection cases.

### Commits

- 7b490f2 — chore: resolve merge conflict in settings.local.json
- ea04dd0 — fix: atomic team creation via RPC + picker refetch on open; prevents both concurrent-device race and stale-data sequential collision

### Commits shipped today

| Hash | Message |
|------|---------|

| `c11d16c` | chore: update STATUS.md for 2026-05-21 homepage polish session |

### What landed

**H.2.5 — Handicap Index Snapshot (`3495720`)**
- Migration `010_phase_h25_handicap_index_snapshot.sql` applied to prod via Supabase MCP
- `round_players.handicap_index_snapshot` column (nullable numeric) added + backfilled
- All INSERT paths updated: RoundSetup.tsx (`toggleInRoster`, `goToTeams`), page.tsx team formation handlers, scorecard
- CH math switched from `players.handicap_index` to `round_players.handicap_index_snapshot` across scorecard, summary, leaderboard, RoundResultsView
- LT1 self-heal gated on `is_complete = false` — finalized rounds no longer drift when HI changes
- Admin HI edit cascade: Players.tsx now also updates snapshot on all active-round `round_players` rows
- 10 new unit tests in `tests/lib/handicap-snapshot.test.ts`
- Live-verified: Gary S started a scorecard; `handicap_index_snapshot` populated on the new row

**TD19 closure — delete legacy `/round/new` route (`07d630b`)**
- Hero pill "+ Start a Scorecard" changed to `<button onClick={handleOpenPicker}>` — opens `PlayerPickerSheet` in `form_team` mode
- `/round/active/page.tsx` fallback link `/round/new` → `/`
- Entire `src/app/round/new/` directory deleted
- 1 new test: hero button opens picker, does not call `router.push`

**Homepage team formation polish (`da458bf`)**
- Hero button: label `+ Form a Team`, yellow `#e8a800` / `#1a1a1a`, `aria-disabled` + `opacity 0.4` when round complete
- Disabled-tap: amber toast ("Round is complete — new teams can't be formed.", 3 s, bg `#fdf0cc` / text `#854f0b`)
- `showToast` extended with optional `duration` + `variant` params — no new component
- Removed "Form a new team" in-card button entirely — hero is the only entry point
- Empty state: ⛳ + "No teams exist yet. Set one up by clicking '+ Form a Team' above." — matches leaderboard pattern
- Tests: 8 click targets updated `"Form a team"/"Form a new team"` → `"+ Form a Team"`, describe blocks rewritten, 1 new disabled-toast test

**Doc updates (this commit)**
- CLAUDE.md: removed deleted `round/new/page.tsx` from date-mock surfaces list
- ROADMAP.md: active priority order updated (H.2.5 complete, removed from queue), H2.5.1–H2.5.6 marked ✅, session log entries added
- STATUS.md: full rewrite

---

## Where we left off

- **356/356 tests** across 38 files. `tsc --noEmit` clean.
- **H.2.5 is live.** Migration 010 applied. Gary S snapshot confirmed on prod.
- **No active round.** The Thursday May 21 live round was the last one; round is finalized.
- **Homepage consolidated.** Single `+ Form a Team` yellow hero button; leaderboard-pattern empty state.
- **Phase H.2.5 fully closed.** All 6 sub-items ✅.

---

## Next priority

1. **Triage beta feedback** from today's live round — watch for UX bugs in the picker / Manage Team flow that surfaced with real users.
2. **Pick next phase:** H.2 (DB backup strategy) is the gating dependency for Phase E (historical import H.5). If backup work is too large, Phase E spec or Phase F.1 are alternatives.
3. **Add to ROADMAP** any new beta feedback items from today's round.

## Previous session — 2026-05-20 (late night PT)

### What landed

Beta feedback sprint for Thursday May 21 live round shipped end-to-end. Player-driven team formation + Manage Team is live (5 commits), blind-draw par display bug fixed, leaderboard now shows per-team THRU N / FINAL caption pro-tour style. Full suite at 344/344. Test rot from a hardcoded-date bug introduced May 20 was also caught and fixed. Round 103 on prod had 2 test scorecards (Teams 7 + 8) cleaned up via SQL Editor.

### Shipped commits

- **Commit 1** — Lift `ensureRoundShell` to `src/lib/round/`
- **Commit 2** — `smartJoin` pure logic + 9 tests
- **Commit 3** — `PlayerPickerSheet` component (two modes, mobile/desktop)
- **Commit 4** (`187f9ed`) — Homepage integration + write queue + smart-join branches + `JoinTeamConfirmModal` + `MixedTeamsErrorModal`
- **Commit 4.5** — Dedupe today's-teams section (was rendering twice); delete `TodaysTeamsList`; fold "Form a new team" into existing card
- **Commit 5** (`c7d4694`) — Manage Team button + sheet on scorecard
- **Commit 6** — Blind-draw par display bug (#2): `drawnPlayerPar` threaded through `results.ts` instead of hardcoded par-4
- **Commit 7** — Pin `todayLocal`/`yesterdayLocal` in `page-team-formation.test.tsx` (test rot introduced by `3b5c5e0`)
- **Commit 8** (`c89a504`) — Leaderboard per-team caption (#3): FINAL / THRU N / —

---

## Tech debt added this session

None new. Prior open items:
- **TD17** — Delete-scorecard affordance on admin RoundSetup. Per-team ⋯ delete with DangerModal; don't renumber gaps.
- **TD18** — Extract `Player` type to `src/lib/types.ts` (currently lives at `@/app/admin/page`; 5 team-formation files import from there).
- **TD20** — `withAdminFlags` in `src/lib/admin.ts` exported but unused. Will be used when summary↔scorecard linking surfaces.
- **TD21** — LT1 self-heal documentation: after H.2.5, the Decisions Locked entry needs a one-line amendment noting self-heal reads from snapshot and only fires on active rounds.

---

## Locked patterns added to CLAUDE.md

No new patterns this session. Existing patterns still in effect:
- **Per-player write queue** — port from RoundSetup.tsx when writing to `round_players`
- **Date-mock requirement** — tests touching `todayLocal`/`yesterdayLocal` must `vi.mock('@/lib/date')`

---

## Known prod state

- Round 103 (May 20): finalized blind-draw round with 6 real teams. Cleaned up.
- Round for May 21: played today; finalized.
- Migrations applied to prod: 001–010 (including 009 drops finalize trigger, 010 adds snapshot column).
- No active live round at sign-off.

---

## Open questions / decisions parked

- None new.

---

## Things to know that aren't obvious from code

- Default Claude Code model is `opusplan` (set in `.claude/settings.local.json`). Plan mode uses Opus, execution drops to Sonnet automatically.
- Pre-implementation walkthrough is the norm before any substantial Claude Code spec. Stack with plan-mode in Claude Code for best results.
- Type imports: `RoundPlayer` / `SmartJoinResult` from `src/lib/teamFormation/smartJoin.ts`. `Player` from `@/app/admin/page` (until TD18 extracts it). No parallel type definitions across team formation files.
- `handicap_index_snapshot` is now the canonical HI for all CH math. `players.handicap_index` is the live/current value only; `round_players.handicap_index_snapshot` is what was in effect at round time.
